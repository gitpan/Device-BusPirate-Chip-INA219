NAME
    `Device::BusPirate::Chip::INA219' - use an INA219 chip with
    `Device::BusPirate'

DESCRIPTION
    This Device::BusPirate::Chip subclass provides specific communication to
    a Texas Instruments INA219 chip attached to the Bus Pirate via I2C.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of this
    chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

METHODS
    The following methods documented with a trailing call to `->get' return
    Future instances.

  $config = $ina->read_config->get
    Reads and returns the current chip configuration as a `HASH' reference.

  $ina->change_config( %config )->get
    Changes the configuration. Any field names not mentioned will be
    preserved.

  $uv = $ina->read_shunt_voltage->get
    Returns the current shunt voltage reading scaled integer in microvolts.

  $mv = $ina->read_bus_voltage->get
  ( $mv, $ovf, $cnvr ) = $ina->read_bus_voltage->get
    Returns the current bus voltage reading, as a scaled integer in
    milivolts.

    The returned Future also yields the OVF and CNVR flags.
